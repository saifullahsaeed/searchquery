# Improving SQLite Query Performance with Indexes
This project aims to demonstrate the impact of indexes on SQLite query performance. We used a publicly available SQLite database containing Spotify song data to test the performance of a search query on a large dataset. We then added indexes to the tables involved in the query to see how much the performance improved.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQLite3
