The query also does not use any filtering or sorting criteria to limit the number of records returned, which can cause the query to return a large number of records and slow down the performance. Furthermore, the query does not use any aggregation or grouping functions, which can cause the query to return duplicate records and slow down the performance.\n",

Finally, we can create indexes on the relevant columns to speed up the query performance.\n",
